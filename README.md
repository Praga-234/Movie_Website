The Movie Search App is a web application built with React that enables users to search for movies and view details about them. Leveraging the OMDB API, users can search for movies by title and retrieve relevant information such as release year, poster image, and genre. Additionally, users have the option to reload the page to get a random selection of movies based on predefined genres.
